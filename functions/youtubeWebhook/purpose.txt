Advanced Integration Connectors: While Whop offers some native integrations,
 there is a significant demand for deeper and more flexible connections with 
 a wider array of third-party services. Think beyond basic Zapier triggers 
 and actions to offer multi-step, conditional workflows with platforms like 
 GoHighLevel, ActiveCampaign, and other CRMs.

Automated Content Distribution: Creators are constantly producing content. An
app that can automatically take a new piece of content (e.g., a new course module,
 a recorded webinar) and distribute it across multiple channels like Discord, Telegram,
  and email lists would be a massive time-saver.

Smart Analytics and Reporting: Whop's native analytics provide a good overview, 
but creators are hungry for more granular data. An app that offers in-depth analytics
 on user engagement, churn prediction, lifetime value, and sales funnel performance
  would be a powerful tool for business growth.
